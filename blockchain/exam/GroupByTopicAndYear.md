**Q (2021/2022 Sem 2 – Question 4(a))**  
Q 4(a) [9 Marks]  
Consider the following Consensus Algorithm:  

Suppose that user A wishes to pay user B one coin. One approach to obtaining consensus (in a decentralized system) on this transaction might involve the following set of steps:  

1. User A broadcasts the payment information (of one coin to B) to all nodes in the network  
2. The nodes contact each other and make sure they all agree on the transaction information.  
3. The nodes then write the payment information as a transaction on the blockchain  

User B receives the payment to their wallet.  

Discuss three situations in which the algorithm would fail. Give examples in each case. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}

### 7.2 Student Records on Public Ethereum (Education Use Case)

**Q (2021/2022 Sem 2 – Question 2(a))**
Q 2(a) [15 Marks]
In order to decentralize the control around student records, recording all student data on the public Ethereum blockchain is proposed. All student assignments and tests will be encoded in a smart contract. When those assignments and tests are completed, a transaction will be immutably recorded on the blockchain. Students can look up their grades publicly on the blockchain and share their grades with any entity or individual, such as a university.

Please comment on the above application of blockchain. Consider in your response:

* the validity of the use case for blockchain (Is blockchain really needed?)
* Does the solution proposed make good use of blockchain or a redesign is needed?
* are there any advantages brought by blockchain? What about disadvantages?

### 7.3 Self-Sovereign Identity on Ethereum

**Q (2021/2022 Sem 2 – Question 3(a))**
Q 3(a) [15 Marks]
A self-sovereign identity solution based on blockchain is proposed that allows a user to create a digital identity, while simultaneously protecting their personally identifiable information. The public Ethereum blockchain is utilized in order to run a smart contract. The smart contract is used to create an identity on the Ethereum network. The smart contract acts as a unique identifier that is tied to cryptographic keys. These keys can be used for authentication, to sign documents, claims, or blockchain transactions. The only data visible on the blockchain are abstract identifiers and the public keys, so no personal data is publicly available. All claims data is held by the user and are not displayed on the blockchain. A wallet to store the claims will exist in the form of a dedicated mobile application, giving the user control over these off-chain claims.

Please comment on the above application of blockchain. Consider in your response the same aspects as for Question 2(a):

* the validity of the use case for blockchain
* whether a redesign is needed
* advantages and disadvantages of using blockchain. 

**Asked:** 2021/2022 Sem 2 – Q3(a) | **Total occurrences of this (or very similar) question:** 1

## Topic 8 – “Meta” / Structural Exam Content (MCQ References)

These aren’t open questions but appear structurally in the papers:

* **2020/2021 Sem 2 – Question 1 [TOTAL MARKS: 25]**
  Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) – (This to be done separately on Loop). 

* **2021/2022 Sem 2 – Question 1 [TOTAL MARKS: 25]**
  QUESTION 1 – MCQ Loop quiz – This question is to be done separately on Loopexam. 

They are noted here for completeness but don’t contain written content to revise.

---

If you’d like, the next step can be:

* regrouping this by **year** instead of topic; or
* extracting just the **high-frequency questions** (e.g. PoW vs PoS, consensus, transparency, PoW & Sybil, smart contract testing) into a shorter “hit list” for last-minute revision.
