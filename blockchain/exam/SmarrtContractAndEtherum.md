Here is a **clean, exam-friendly summary** of **6_Web3.0 DApps. Ethereum** based on your slides.

# ✅ **SUMMARY – Web 3.0, DApps, and Ethereum (Easy to Remember)**

---

# ⭐ 1. What is Web 3.0?

Web 3.0 shifts from platform-controlled internet (Web 2.0) to **ownership-based internet**, where users control:

* identity
* assets
* data
* interactions via blockchain

**Core idea:**

> Programmable ownership + decentralization.

**Building blocks:**

* Blockchain
* Smart contracts
* Wallets
* Tokens/NFTs
* Decentralized storage (IPFS)

---

# ⭐ 2. Evolution of the Web (Very Simple)

### **Web 1.0 → Read**

Static pages, no user-generated content.

### **Web 2.0 → Read + Write**

Platforms (YouTube, Facebook), user content, but centralized control.

### **Web 3.0 → Read + Write + Own**

Users own assets/data, dApps replace platforms, blockchain = trust layer.

---

# ⭐ 3. Layer 2 Blockchains (Why They Exist)

Layer 2 improves Ethereum’s scalability by:

* processing transactions off-chain
* bundling them
* sending a compressed version to Ethereum (Layer 1)

Benefits:
✔ faster
✔ cheaper
✔ inherits Ethereum’s security

Examples:

* **Optimistic Rollups**
* **ZK Rollups**
* **Lightning Network (Bitcoin)**

---

# ⭐ 4. What Are DApps (Decentralized Applications)?

DApps run on blockchain using smart contracts.

They must be:

1. **Open-source**
2. **Decentralized** (data on blockchain)
3. **Token-powered**
4. **Have a built-in consensus mechanism**

### **Types of DApps**

* **Type I** – use their own blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin)
* **Type II** – built on Type I (e.g., Omni on Bitcoin)
* **Type III** – built on Type II protocols

**Unique feature:**

> Once deployed, they run without a centralized authority.

---

# ⭐ 5. Bitcoin as a DApp

Bitcoin **is a Type I DApp** because:

* It is open-source
* Completely decentralized
* Uses native token (BTC)
* Uses PoW for consensus

---

# ⭐ 6. Why Ethereum Matters

Ethereum = blockchain for **smart contracts + dApps**.

### **Key innovations**

* EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
* Smart contracts
* Tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721 NFTs)
* Large ecosystem of DApps

Ethereum allows programmable logic, unlike Bitcoin.

---

# ⭐ 7. Ethereum Architecture (Simplified)

### **Accounts**

* **EOA** (Externally Owned Account)
* **Contract Account**

### **Gas**

Gas = fee to run smart contracts / transactions.

### **Transactions**

Can:

* send ETH
* deploy contracts
* call contract functions

### **Blocks**

Contain:

* transactions
* state updates
* Merkle root
* PoW/PoS validation info

---

# ⭐ 8. Ethereum 2.0 (Now merged)

Ethereum upgraded to:

* **Proof of Stake**
* **Beacon Chain**
* **Sharding** (parallel processing)

Goals:
✔ faster
✔ greener
✔ scalable

---

# 🎯 **SUPER SHORT MEMORY SUMMARY**

**Web 3 = Ownership Web**
**DApps = apps on blockchain, open-source + decentralized + tokenized**
**Ethereum = smart contract platform powering DApps**
**Layer 2 = scalability boosters**
**ETH 2.0 = PoS + sharding → faster + greener**
