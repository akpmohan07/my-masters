Thank you for being honest — this helps a lot.

You are **right**: what you want is **much richer content**, with **more explanation, more detail, more “exam-usable substance”**, and **the same explanatory format I used while teaching**, not summaries.

Below is a **FULL, HIGH-DENSITY REVISION DOCUMENT** that **re-includes everything we discussed**, but **expanded**, **slower**, **with reasoning**, **implications**, and **exam signals**.

This is long on purpose.
This is the level that lets you **reproduce answers confidently**.

# 🔴 FINAL HIGH-DENSITY REVISION (FULL CONTENT)

**Professional & Research Practice – Ethics & Law**

---

## 1️⃣ What “Ethics” and “Morality” Mean (Foundation)

### Why the term “moral” exists

The word *moral* comes from the Latin **mores**, meaning customs or ways of life.
This tells us that morality is not about facts like science, but about **how humans ought to behave** toward one another.

### Core meaning

A moral issue exists whenever an action involves:

* harm or risk of harm
* fairness or injustice
* rights or duties
* respect for persons
* responsibility for consequences

Ethics exists because **reasonable people disagree** about how these should be judged.

### Why examiners care

Every ethics question tests whether you can:

* identify a moral issue
* explain *why* it is morally significant
* justify judgement rather than assert opinion

---

## 2️⃣ Moral Relativism (Deep Explanation)

### Why it is called *moral* relativism

It is called *moral* relativism because it makes a claim about **moral truth itself**, not behaviour or culture.

The term *relativism* means “relative rather than absolute”.

### Core idea (rebuilt slowly)

Moral relativism claims:

* there is **no single universal moral truth**
* moral right and wrong depend on individual or societal beliefs
* no moral judgement applies everywhere and always

This is not saying people have no morals — it says morals **differ without a final referee**.

### Logical reasoning behind it

1. Different societies disagree deeply about moral rules
2. There is no agreed neutral authority to settle these disputes
3. Therefore, moral truth must be relative to societies

### Moral paralysis (critical concept)

Because there is no universal standard:

* we may recognise harm
* but feel unable to say “this is wrong for everyone”

This hesitation is called **moral paralysis**:
seeing wrongdoing but lacking moral authority to condemn it strongly.

### Impact on international judgement

In global politics or technology ethics:

* surveillance
* censorship
* harsh criminal penalties

Moral relativism leads to acceptance because:

> “Their values are different, so we cannot say they are wrong in themselves.”

---

## 3️⃣ Cultural Relativism (Deep Explanation)

### Why it is called *cultural* relativism

It focuses on **culture**, not truth:

* traditions
* history
* religion
* shared social norms

### Core idea (plain but precise)

Cultural relativism argues:

> Moral practices must be **understood within their cultural context** before being judged.

It is primarily a **method of interpretation**, not a denial of morality.

### How cultural relativism is done (important for exams)

The process works like this:

1. Suspend immediate judgement
2. Investigate cultural background
3. Understand local values and pressures
4. Interpret actions within those norms
5. Only then evaluate

### Why this leads to acceptance of other states’ behaviour

Acceptance happens because:

* behaviour is explained rather than condemned
* actions are seen as reasonable *within that culture*

This reduces external criticism, especially in:

* internet regulation
* speech restrictions
* state surveillance

### Key danger (examiner favourite)

When applied uncritically, cultural relativism can:

* excuse human rights violations
* protect abuse under the label of “culture”

---

## 4️⃣ Moral vs Cultural Relativism (Critical Distinction)

Moral relativism denies **universal moral truth**.
Cultural relativism reshapes **how judgement is made**.

Moral relativism removes the judge.
Cultural relativism asks the judge to read the local rules first.

---

## 5️⃣ Logical Fallacies (Full Content)

### Why fallacies matter

Fallacies are not stupidity — they are **persuasive errors**.
They appear logical, which is why they mislead.

### Definition

A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning where a conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, even if the conclusion might be true.

---

### Ad Hominem

Attacking the person instead of the argument.

Example:

> “His statistics are unreliable because he is a politician.”

Why it fails:

* personal traits do not refute evidence

Not a fallacy when:

* credibility is directly relevant (e.g. expert testimony).

---

### Appeal to Authority

Claiming something is true because an authority says so.

Fallacious when:

* authority lacks expertise
* evidence is absent

Not fallacious when:

* expert speaks within their field
* evidence supports the claim

---

### Circular Reasoning

The conclusion is assumed in the premise.

Example:

> “This law is just because it is the law.”

---

### Texas Sharpshooter

Cherry-picking data after results are known.

Used heavily in:

* politics
* advertising
* selective statistics

---

### Anecdotal Fallacy

Using personal experience as general proof.

Example:

> “I was never hacked, so cybersecurity threats are exaggerated.”

---

### Correlation ≠ Causation

Mistaking coincidence or association for cause.

Example:

> “Smartphone use increased and attention spans declined, so smartphones caused it.”

---

### Fallacy Fallacy

A flawed argument does **not** mean the conclusion is false.
It only means the reasoning is bad.

---

## 6️⃣ Ethical Theories (Expanded)

Ethical theories exist to:

* structure moral reasoning
* guide judgement under disagreement
* prevent arbitrary decisions

---

## 7️⃣ Utilitarianism

### Why it is named this way

From **utility** = benefit, usefulness.

### Core principle

3. Choose the option with maximum net benefit

### Strengths

* practical
* policy-oriented
* outcome-sensitive

### Weaknesses

* minorities may be sacrificed
* rights can be overridden
* “ends justify means” risk

---

## 8️⃣ Deontology

### Why it is named this way

From Greek **deon** = duty.

### Core principle

Actions are right or wrong based on **duties and rights**, regardless of outcomes.

### Key concept: Informational autonomy

People have a moral right to control their own personal data.

### Strengths

* strong rights protection
* limits abuse of power
* respects dignity

### Weaknesses

* rigidity
* less flexible in emergencies

---

* weak global obligation

---

What leaked: internal research showing teen mental harm.

Deontology:

* breach of honesty
* lack of informed consent

Virtue ethics:

* lack of care
* lack of responsibility
