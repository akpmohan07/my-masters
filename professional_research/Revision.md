Thank you for being honest — this helps a lot.

You are **right**: what you want is **much richer content**, with **more explanation, more detail, more “exam-usable substance”**, and **the same explanatory format I used while teaching**, not summaries.

Below is a **FULL, HIGH-DENSITY REVISION DOCUMENT** that **re-includes everything we discussed**, but **expanded**, **slower**, **with reasoning**, **implications**, and **exam signals**.

This is long on purpose.
This is the level that lets you **reproduce answers confidently**.

# 🔴 FINAL HIGH-DENSITY REVISION (FULL CONTENT)

**Professional & Research Practice – Ethics & Law**

---

## 1️⃣ What “Ethics” and “Morality” Mean (Foundation)

### Why the term “moral” exists

The word *moral* comes from the Latin **mores**, meaning customs or ways of life.
This tells us that morality is not about facts like science, but about **how humans ought to behave** toward one another.

### Core meaning

A moral issue exists whenever an action involves:

* harm or risk of harm
* fairness or injustice
* rights or duties
* respect for persons
* responsibility for consequences

Ethics exists because **reasonable people disagree** about how these should be judged.

### Why examiners care

Every ethics question tests whether you can:

* identify a moral issue
* explain *why* it is morally significant
* justify judgement rather than assert opinion

---

## 2️⃣ Moral Relativism (Deep Explanation)

### Why it is called *moral* relativism

It is called *moral* relativism because it makes a claim about **moral truth itself**, not behaviour or culture.

The term *relativism* means “relative rather than absolute”.

### Core idea (rebuilt slowly)

Moral relativism claims:

* there is **no single universal moral truth**
* moral right and wrong depend on individual or societal beliefs
* no moral judgement applies everywhere and always

This is not saying people have no morals — it says morals **differ without a final referee**.

### Logical reasoning behind it

1. Different societies disagree deeply about moral rules
2. There is no agreed neutral authority to settle these disputes
3. Therefore, moral truth must be relative to societies

### Moral paralysis (critical concept)

Because there is no universal standard:

* we may recognise harm
* but feel unable to say “this is wrong for everyone”

This hesitation is called **moral paralysis**:
seeing wrongdoing but lacking moral authority to condemn it strongly.

### Impact on international judgement

In global politics or technology ethics:

* surveillance
* censorship
* harsh criminal penalties

Moral relativism leads to acceptance because:

> “Their values are different, so we cannot say they are wrong in themselves.”

---

## 3️⃣ Cultural Relativism (Deep Explanation)

### Why it is called *cultural* relativism

It focuses on **culture**, not truth:

* traditions
* history
* religion
* shared social norms

### Core idea (plain but precise)

Cultural relativism argues:

> Moral practices must be **understood within their cultural context** before being judged.

It is primarily a **method of interpretation**, not a denial of morality.

### How cultural relativism is done (important for exams)

The process works like this:

1. Suspend immediate judgement
2. Investigate cultural background
3. Understand local values and pressures
4. Interpret actions within those norms
5. Only then evaluate

### Why this leads to acceptance of other states’ behaviour

Acceptance happens because:

* behaviour is explained rather than condemned
* actions are seen as reasonable *within that culture*

This reduces external criticism, especially in:

* internet regulation
* speech restrictions
* state surveillance

### Key danger (examiner favourite)

When applied uncritically, cultural relativism can:

* excuse human rights violations
* protect abuse under the label of “culture”

---

## 4️⃣ Moral vs Cultural Relativism (Critical Distinction)

Moral relativism denies **universal moral truth**.
Cultural relativism reshapes **how judgement is made**.

Moral relativism removes the judge.
Cultural relativism asks the judge to read the local rules first.

---

## 5️⃣ Logical Fallacies (Full Content)

### Why fallacies matter

Fallacies are not stupidity — they are **persuasive errors**.
They appear logical, which is why they mislead.

### Definition

A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning where a conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, even if the conclusion might be true.

---

### Ad Hominem

Attacking the person instead of the argument.

Example:

> “His statistics are unreliable because he is a politician.”

Why it fails:

* personal traits do not refute evidence

Not a fallacy when:

* credibility is directly relevant (e.g. expert testimony).

---

### Appeal to Authority

Claiming something is true because an authority says so.

Fallacious when:

* authority lacks expertise
* evidence is absent

Not fallacious when:

* expert speaks within their field
* evidence supports the claim

---

### Circular Reasoning

The conclusion is assumed in the premise.

Example:

> “This law is just because it is the law.”

---

### Texas Sharpshooter

Cherry-picking data after results are known.

Used heavily in:

* politics
* advertising
* selective statistics

---

### Anecdotal Fallacy

Using personal experience as general proof.

Example:

> “I was never hacked, so cybersecurity threats are exaggerated.”

---

### Correlation ≠ Causation

Mistaking coincidence or association for cause.

Example:

> “Smartphone use increased and attention spans declined, so smartphones caused it.”

---

### Fallacy Fallacy

A flawed argument does **not** mean the conclusion is false.
It only means the reasoning is bad.

---

## 6️⃣ Ethical Theories (Expanded)

Ethical theories exist to:

* structure moral reasoning
* guide judgement under disagreement
* prevent arbitrary decisions

---

## 7️⃣ Utilitarianism

### Why it is named this way

From **utility** = benefit, usefulness.

* “ends justify means” risk

---

## 8️⃣ Deontology

### Why it is named this way

From Greek **deon** = duty.

### Core principle

Actions are right or wrong based on **duties and rights**, regardless of outcomes.

### Key concept: Informational autonomy

People have a moral right to control their own personal data.

### Strengths

* strong rights protection
* limits abuse of power
* respects dignity

### Weaknesses

### Strengths

* clear limits
* political realism

### Weaknesses

* weak global obligation

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Case Studies

### FBI v Apple

Utilitarian view: may justify access for safety.
Deontological view: rejects backdoors as rights violations.

---

### Facebook / Instagram Leaks

What leaked: internal research showing teen mental harm.

Deontology:

* breach of honesty
* lack of informed consent

Virtue ethics:

* lack of care
* lack of responsibility

Utilitarian defence:

* engagement benefits
* challenged by harm to vulnerable users

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Privacy Concepts

### Natural Privacy

Privacy from physical barriers like distance and effort.

### Normative Privacy

Privacy from social expectations about appropriate use.

### Key insight

Technology destroys natural privacy but **not moral expectations**.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Contextual Integrity (Nissenbaum)

Privacy is preserved when information flows **appropriately within a context**, considering:

* actors
* attributes
* transmission principles

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ GDPR Principles (Expanded)

GDPR is principle-based, not rule-based.

Principles:

* lawfulness, fairness, transparency
* purpose limitation
* data minimisation
* accuracy
* storage limitation
* integrity and confidentiality
* accountability

Organisations must **prove** compliance, not assume it.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ DPO

Required when:

* new technologies
* large-scale or sensitive data
* surveillance or profiling

Steps:

* understand data flows

# ✅ CHECKPOINT REVISION SUMMARY

*(From “Max Schrems” onward – today’s work only)*

---

## 1️⃣ Max Schrems Challenges & Effects on EU Data Protection Law

### Core issue

Max Schrems challenged the **transfer of EU personal data to the US**, arguing that EU citizens’ privacy rights were not protected once data became subject to US surveillance law.

### Schrems I (2015)

* Invalidated **Safe Harbor**
* Found US surveillance + lack of legal redress incompatible with EU fundamental rights
* Immediate effect: thousands of companies lost a legal transfer mechanism

### Schrems II (2020)

* Invalidated **Privacy Shield**
* Confirmed US law undermines EU-equivalent protection
* **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) remain valid**, but only with safeguards

### Main effects

* No “easy” EU–US data transfers
* Companies must assess foreign laws (Transfer Risk Assessments)
* Stronger focus on **fundamental rights over trade convenience**
* Increased responsibility on organisations (accountability)

---

## 2️⃣ Safe Harbor vs Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

### Safe Harbor

* EU–US political agreement
* Based on **self-certification**
* Weak enforcement
* Failed because promises did not stop US government access
* **Completely invalidated**

### Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

* Binding legal contracts between data exporter and importer
* Enforceable by data subjects
* Survived Schrems II **conditionally**
* Now require:

  * assessment of foreign surveillance law
  * supplementary safeguards (e.g. encryption)
  * suspension if protection cannot be ensured

### Key takeaway

Safe Harbor relied on trust.
SCCs require **proof and ongoing assessment**.

---

## 3️⃣ US CLOUD Act & Data Stored in Ireland

### What the CLOUD Act does

Allows US authorities to compel **US companies** to provide data **even if stored outside the US**, including Ireland.

### Why this matters for Ireland

* Data can be physically in Ireland but legally accessible from the US
* Creates **conflict of laws** between GDPR and US disclosure orders
* Undermines the idea that “EU data centres = EU-only protection”

### Microsoft & Amazon examples

* Microsoft Ireland case showed server location does not settle jurisdiction
* AWS acknowledges compelled disclosure may apply globally

### Link to Schrems II

Schrems II does **not fight the CLOUD Act directly**, but it blocks its effects by requiring EU-equivalent protection before exposure to US law.

---

## 4️⃣ Harassment, Harmful Communications & Related Offences Act 2020 (Ireland)

### Purpose

Modernises criminal law to address **online harassment and digital harm**.

### IT-relevant features

### IT & company impact

* Digital systems are now recognised as tools of harm
* Logs, records, and moderation matter
* Companies must take misuse of platforms seriously
* Workplace IT misuse can have criminal consequences

---

## 5️⃣ Online Safety & Media Regulation Act 2022 (Commenced 2023)

### Core purpose

### Key features

* Clarifies digital copyright
* Reinforces protection for software and databases
* Introduces **Text and Data Mining (TDM) exceptions**
* Strengthens enforcement and licensing mechanisms

### Importance for software

* Code (source + object) protected as literary works
* Databases protected where substantial investment exists
* TDM exceptions enable AI and data-driven innovation

### Criticisms (especially for software)

* Copyright protects expression, not algorithms or logic
* Software patents remain unclear
* TDM may weaken creator control
* Compliance burdens fall harder on SMEs

---

## 7️⃣ Extending Current Privacy Law to AI

### Why AI is a challenge

AI:

* reuses data
* makes automated decisions
* operates opaquely
* can cause bias and group harm

### How privacy law could be extended

* Stronger **transparency and explainability**
* Tighter **purpose limitation** for AI training
* Expanded rights around automated decision-making
* Mandatory AI-focused DPIAs
* Linking privacy with fairness and discrimination

### Key idea

AI does not replace privacy law — it **stress-tests it**.

---

## 8️⃣ EU AI Act – Risk-Based Structure & Transparency

### Risk categories

* **Unacceptable risk** → banned (e.g. social scoring)
* **High risk** → allowed with strict safeguards (e.g. hiring AI)
* **Limited risk** → transparency required (e.g. chatbots, deepfakes)
* **Minimal risk** → largely unregulated (e.g. photo filters)

### Transparency across levels

* High risk → documentation, explainability, auditability
* Limited risk → disclosure that AI is being used
* Minimal risk → voluntary transparency

### Core principle

**Higher AI risk = higher legal visibility and obligation**

---

## 🧠 ONE-PAGE MEMORY HOOK (All Checkpoint Topics)

* Schrems → **EU rights over US access**
* SCCs → **contracts + risk assessment**
* CLOUD Act → **data in Ireland, keys in America**
* Harassment Act → **online harm = real crime**
* Online Safety Act → **platform responsibility**
* Copyright Act → **modernised, but imperfect for software**
* AI + privacy → **extend principles, don’t abandon them**
* EU AI Act → **ban the worst, regulate the serious, label the deceptive**
