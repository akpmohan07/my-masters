Here is a **clear, complete recap of everything you have studied so far**, written in a **clean exam-ready way**, so you can see the *big picture* before moving to the next topic.

## What We Have Studied So Far

### **Topic 1: Introduction to Privacy**

### Big Picture First

You studied **privacy as a philosophical, ethical, and social concept**, especially in relation to **modern technology**.
The focus was **not law or technical fixes**, but **why privacy matters, how it is understood, and how technology threatens it**.

---

## 1. What Privacy Is (and How We Talk About It)

* Privacy is **difficult to define positively**
* It is often described **negatively**, as something that can be:

  * lost
  * invaded
  * violated
  * breached

👉 This shows that privacy is usually **noticed only when it disappears**, not when it exists.

---

## 2. Why Privacy Matters in the Digital Age

* Privacy affects **everyone**, even people who:

  * don’t use computers much
  * don’t actively use social media
* Everyday activities generate data:

  * shopping
  * banking
  * CCTV
  * GPS
  * web browsing

Technology makes privacy problems worse because of:

* the **amount** of data collected
* the **speed** of transfer
* the **duration** of storage
* the **type** of data collected (behavioural, location, transactional)

---

## 3. Types of Privacy in Daily Life

You learned that privacy concerns appear in:

* **Consumer privacy**
* **Medical / healthcare privacy**
* **Employee / workplace privacy**

Privacy is therefore **not limited to one area of life**.

---

## 4. Classical (Traditional) Theories of Privacy

You studied **three classical theories**, each focusing on a different aspect:

1. **Accessibility (Non-intrusion) Privacy**

   * Privacy as being “left alone”
   * Protection of physical space
   * Rooted in ideas like the Fourth Amendment

2. **Decisional (Non-interference) Privacy**

   * Privacy as freedom to make personal decisions
   * Linked to autonomy and personal choice
   * Emerged from cases like *Griswold v. Connecticut*

3. **Informational Privacy**

   * Privacy as control over personal information
   * Especially important in computer systems

👉 Each theory captures **part** of privacy, but none alone is sufficient.

---

## 5. Contextual Privacy Theories (Modern Approach)

### Moor’s Theory

* Combines all three classical theories
* Privacy exists **in a situation**
* Introduces:

  * **Natural (descriptive) privacy**
  * **Normative privacy (a right)**

Important distinction:

* **Loss of privacy** ≠ **violation of privacy**
* A violation occurs only in **normatively protected contexts**

---

### Nissenbaum’s Contextual Integrity

* Privacy depends on **context**, not secrecy
* Two key norms:

  * **Norms of appropriateness** (what data fits the context)
  * **Norms of distribution** (where data is allowed to flow)

Privacy is violated when:

* information moves **outside its proper context**

---

## 6. Privacy as a Value

You explored **what kind of value privacy is**:

* Privacy is **not purely intrinsic**
* But it is **more than merely instrumental**
* It is **necessary** for:

  * trust
  * friendship
  * intimacy
  * autonomy
  * security

---

## 7. Privacy, Autonomy, and Democracy

* **Autonomy** = self-rule (ability to make free choices)

* Privacy is required for genuine autonomy

* Without privacy, people self-censor

* **Democracy** depends on:

  * free expression
  * dissent
  * resistance to coercion

* Privacy protects democratic processes (e.g. secret ballot)

👉 Privacy is a **social value**, not just an individual preference.

---

## 8. Major Privacy Threats from Technology

You examined **three technological challenges**:

1. **Data Gathering**

   * Cookies, GPS, RFID, tracking
   * Often invisible and non-consensual
   * Threatens location privacy

2. **Data Exchanging / Merging / Matching**

   * Combining databases across contexts
   * Violates Nissenbaum’s norms of distribution
   * Treats everyone as a suspect

3. **Data Mining**

   * Infers new facts and profiles
   * Judges individuals by statistical association
   * Enables predictive discrimination

---

## 9. Cambridge Analytica

* Largest social-media privacy scandal
* Demonstrated:

  * context collapse
  * data weaponisation
  * democratic manipulation

A **perfect real-world example** of everything in Topic 1.

---

## 10. Why Privacy Is a Starting Point for Ethics

You learned that privacy:

* exposes power imbalances
* reveals hidden harms
* helps analyse new technologies ethically

👉 That’s why privacy is often the **first lens** used in ethical evaluation.

---

## One Exam-Ready Summary Sentence

> Privacy is best understood as a contextual and socially necessary value that underpins autonomy, trust, and democratic participation, and is therefore a central concern in the ethical analysis of modern technology.
